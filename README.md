Message Board Application

The message board application you are going to build has the following requirements:

- [X] MUST use Angular and MongoDB

Your Front End should have two inputs:
- [X] One for the user's name,
- [X] the other for the user's message.
- [X] Additionally, there should be a submit button,

- [X] When the submit button is clicked, you must send the name and message from the
inputs to the server to be written to a Mongo Database

- [X] Once the message has been successfully written to the database,
display all messages on the DOM.

- [X] If the application page is reloaded, all previous messages should appear.
